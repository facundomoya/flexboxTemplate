# **Flexbox Template**

## Project Description

This project was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 to mainly practice **flexbox**.
Despite being a simple one-page site, it is fully responsive for all types of devices. This was achieved with the practice of media queries.

The site only seeks to improve the practice of flexbox through the use of its properties. On the site you can see examples with most of its properties. They are little square containers that have numbers and different flexbox properties applied to them to align them in different ways. It does not have a *navbar* or *footer* since it is not necessary for the purpose of the site.
